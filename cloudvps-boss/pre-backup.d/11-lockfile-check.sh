Dear user,

This is a message to inform you that your backup to the CloudVPS 
Object Store has not succeeded on date: $(date) (server date/time).

This is because the backup lockfile still exists.

The backupscript has noticed that the last initiated job was still running after 24 hours. This is unusual behaviour and could lead to hanging backup processes. 

Should this process hang for 24 hours as well, you will receive this message again, then CloudVPS Boss needs investigation to see what is causing the issues. Please contact support@cloudvps.com and forward this email.

Your files have not been backupped during this session.

This is server $(curl -s http://ip.raymii.org). You are using CloudVPS Boss ${VERSION}
to backup files to the CloudVPS Object Store.

Kind regards,
CloudVPS Boss

Dear user,

This is a message to inform you that your backup to the CloudVPS 
Object Store has not succeeded on date: $(date) (server date/time).

This is because the backup lockfile still exists.

The script has investigated this problem and has stated that the current running backup process has not passed the 24 hour run limit yet.

Therefore this backup job will not continue to make sure that the current process can succeed without errors.

Currently, there is no intervention needed from your side, CloudVPS Boss has already chosen the appropriate solution at this point.

Your files have not been backupped during this session.

This is server $(curl -s http://ip.raymii.org). You are using CloudVPS Boss ${VERSION}
to backup files to the CloudVPS Object Store.

Kind regards,
